# About Project Barghos
Project Barghos is a set of multiple smaller libraries providing utilities and structures covering diverse general-use aswell as scientific applications.
Its goal is to heavily reduce boilerplate code, provide a common api that is used across all barghos subprojects and is easily extendable and also provide
easier and more intuitive ways to work with familiar structures like mathematical vectors to write cleaner code and still maintain a good performance.

The project originally started as "utilslib" and is till today maintained along the development of the CodeRed Game Engine.
Therefore the biggest part of the libraries are focused on common problems you could run into while developing a game engine.
But there are plans to extend the libraries with physics, financial calculations and AI and deep learning.

# Project Barghos Math Library
This part of Project Barghos contains mathematical structures like vectors and matrices and provides functionalities for most mathematical applications.
